Design patterns are usually split into 3 categories:

- Creational Patterns
  
  - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
  - Explicit (constructors) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc)
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs picewise (step-by-step)

- Structural Patterns

  - Concerned with the structure (class members, etc)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class's interface
  - Stress the importance of good API design

- Behavioural Patterns

  - All quite different, no central theme
