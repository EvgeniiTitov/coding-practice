When dealing with data structures, its worth paying attention to:
1) Time complexity 
2) Space complexity
3) Thread safety

### ADT vs Data Structure

- ADT (Abstract Data Type) - a "model" or "blueprint" for a data structure. 
Defines an interface (functions/operations) that a data struture needs to support
to be considered as such.

- Data Structure - the implementation of an Abstract Data Type.
