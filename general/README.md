### ML

- General topics / concepts to get familiar with:
  - Monitoring models in production, how do we know when its performance deteriorates?
  - Feature drift 
  - AB testing
  - Business metrics (inc sales, click-through rate, redemption, activation)
  - Propensity score matching (PSM)
  - Further reading about MLOPs (off-the-shelf solutions and approaches)


- Models (training, preprocessing, GPUs, distributes training, scoring, 
post training optimisation - ONNX/TensorRT):
  - Light GBM
  - XGBoost


- Frameworks / packages:
  - TFX
  - pandas
  - lightgbm
  - xgboost


- Feature Stores:
  - How it works
  - How to build one
  - What tech to use to build one etc


- Recommendation engines:
  - How they work
  - What models they use
  - What features they rely on etc


- Time series

### Soft skills / behavioral / culture

- eCommerce (how it works as a field + tech)
  - How do we track customers online? How do we collect their events for model scoring etc?
- CCAT / IQ tests
- Most popular behavioral questions + read how to properly handle/do things 
they ask (take criticism, handle disagreements etc)
- Take the Behavioral course by AlgoMonster
